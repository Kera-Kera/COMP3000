# COMP3000
Coursework for COMP3000

This project was a look into how AI can be implemented into FPS games

Use tactics and thought to win against an AI who is very good with a sniper rifle. First to 10 kills wins

Both the AI and the Player are evenly match with the same set of tools, who will win?

The AI path finding was a NavMesh solution, it uses the players last now locations and nearest weapons/nearest points of interest to decide where it wants to go,
and the priority of killing the player too.

The AI was a first look into what can be done with a behaviour tree. This project will be worked upon at a later date to make a finished product worthy of release.
